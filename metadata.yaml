description: 'Famed essayist and journalist Charles Dudley Warner (1829-1900) was
  the editor of the Hartford, Connecticut, Courant and a contributing editor to Harper''s
  Magazine. Our Italy (1891) is Warner''s account of a trip he made to Southern California
  in 1890. He describes conditions after the collapse of the 1886-1887 real estate
  boom and dubs the state south of the Sierra Madres "our Italy." He focuses on the
  region''s economic future: its promise as a healthy, productive residence, agricultural
  developments (particularly the citrus industry), climate and industry. He devotes
  less attention to beauty spots and tourist attractions, but he does discuss the
  Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Monterey.'
